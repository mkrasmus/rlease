# rlease
A tenant-centric lease availability platform, where lease periods are visible and renters can signal interest in upcoming vacancies.

# Core Features

## Tenant Lease Timeline

Tenants can log their current lease (address, suburb, lease start/end dates, intent to renew or vacate). Lease details could be private to the landlord/agent, but anonymized info could show to other tenants (“2BR apartment, Carlton, lease ending July 2026”).

## Upcoming Vacancy Alerts

Other renters can “watch” suburbs or properties. They get notified when a lease is due to expire or when a tenant marks they are moving out.

## Pre-Apply Functionality

Interested renters can submit pre-applications (e.g. ID check, rental history, references) that landlords/agents can review before advertising. Could reduce churn/advertising cost for landlords.

## Landlord & Agent Dashboard

See upcoming lease expirations. Review pre-applications to lock in new tenants early. Option to retain tenants by offering early renewal terms.

## Tenant Privacy & Incentives

Tenants might be reluctant to share lease details publicly → must ensure data privacy (no exact address unless permission given). Incentive: tenants could receive rewards (reduced moving costs, referral bonus) for listing their move-out intention early.
